# drupal-to-elasticsearch
Lets migrate Drupal data into Elasticsearch


## Motivation

Due to the lack of serious elasticsearch surpport for Drupal 6 we need a platform that will let us migrate specific 
entities onto elasticsearch for the purpose of future reuse of those in a non-Drupal microservice or in bespoke migration tool
between Drupal versions/installations. 
Planned coverage of entities:
- nodes + all CCK fields
- taxonomies
- menus

### What works

Nothing yet! :)
We're just about to have some tests written
